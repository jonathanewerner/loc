# loc

`loc` is a LOC counter that respects `*.gitignore` and shows summaries for a whole git repo from any subfolder of this repo. 

It also respects an optional `*.locignore` in which you can specify additional globbing patterns for files/folders that should not be counted.

## Dependencies
- `sloccount`
- `python3`

## Setup
- add this repos folder to your `$PATH`

## Usage:
- run `loc` from any folder in a git repo.
